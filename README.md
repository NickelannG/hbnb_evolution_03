# Hbnb Evolution Project: Part 03 Front-end Web Development

For Hbnb Evolution Part 3, we are focusing on the front-end aspect using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (ES6). From here on, our backend system for Hbnb was completed in Hbnb Evolution Part 2 and there should be almost none to minimal changes to all backend scripts.

## Objectives

Our task will be to design and implement an interactive homepage & admin page which implements client-side functionality to interact with the back-end API. By doing so, we've applied modern web development practices to create the dynamic web application.

## Frameworks & Tools

The following tools & web frameworks were used for this project (mostly in back-end):
- MySQL
  - If your MySQL does not start automatically, start up MySQL in the cmd before running the application:
  ```
  service mysql start
  ```
- JSON
- Flask (SQLAlchemy)
- Figma (UI/UX)
- SCSS

## Description

HBnb Part 03 is only where we start implementing the design we wanted for our homepage. On our homepage, the main components that incorporate our back-end functionality is our 'Destinations', 'Amenities' and admin page sections/containers.

After we created our design on Figma, we began to review our HTML scripts for the 'index' as well as the CSS/SCSS stylesheet for it.

## Installation

To install this program, clone this repository using the git clone command as shown below:
```
git clone https:[KEY]//github.com/kdn95/hbnb_evolution_03.git
```

## Run the application
**RECOMMENDED**
You can run the application from the command line:
```
./app.py
```

*If you are using VS Code, you can right-click the "index.html" file (found in /static/templates dir) and click "Preview" ONLY if you have "Live Preview" extension installed (or any html preview extension. However, we have only tried this with 'Live Preview'. Other html preview extensions may not work similarly to Live Preview).*
